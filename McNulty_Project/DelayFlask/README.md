## Exploring Flask app for predictions

Using a pickle version of the Seatac ontime/delay arrival model, a flask app was created.  
The specifics of a flight can be inputted into the app and a prediction of ontime or delay
is generated.   

The app is a crude start at a final app.  In the future I would like to pull the weather prediction information from
an api so the user would not need to look it up and manually enter the information.  I would also like to pull flight information
automatically so the user would only need to enter the airline and flight number.
